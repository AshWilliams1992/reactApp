A simple react ecommerce app, with json and animations

This is an example about my react experience: 
I worked on transiction, repeated items from a json and a simple summary list when you add a product. 

Those are the tecnologies I used:
Node.js;
React;
Html5 and Sass;
Gulp to compile and minified Sass;
Greensock for animations;
Photoshop;
